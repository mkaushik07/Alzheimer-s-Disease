# Alzheimer-s-Disease

Alzheimer’s disease may be an encephalopathy that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills and, eventually, the power to hold out the simplest tasks. People with Alzheimer’s also experience changes in behavior and personality. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the cause of over 60% of dementia cases (Burns and Iliffe, 2009). The disease would finally cause the death of patients.Proper diagnosis of AD is crucial for creating treatment plans to weigh down the accomplished AD.It has been observed that not all parameters are equally important. The number of features can be reduced, which simplifies the classification. PCA is the commonly used feature extraction method in the literature. The main disadvantage of the PCA method does not consider the grouping class variable. A better feature selection method using stepwise ANOVA discriminant analysis is compared with PCA. It performs essential feature selection rather than feature extraction without much loss in classification accuracy. A feature selection method, i.e., analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to reduce computations and time complexity while overcoming the curse of dimensionality to improve accuracy. We have compared the mae (mean absolute error) score of the ANFIS model with and without feature selection. ANFIS (adaptive- network based fuzzy inference system) helps to optimize the if-else rules of fuzzy systems with the help of neural networks.
